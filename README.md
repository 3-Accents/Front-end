* Description:
  - AnteUp is an application which enables people to bet against eachother for fun! The bets do not necissarily revolve around money and can be something like: loser must die their hair blue for a week. The users are able to log in via facebook, send bet requests to other users, view the status of said bet and vote on who the winner is. The categories a bet can fall into are as follows:
    * Past: The bet has opened, closed and a winner was decided. 
    * Active: The bet has opened but has not closed yet. 
    * Outgoing: The user has sent a request but the opponent hasn't accepted yet. 
    * Incoming: A friend has sent a request but the user hasnt accepted yet. 
    * Voting: A bet has started and the end date has passed and the user/opponent are voting on who won.
    * Void: A bet was sent out and either the user or opponent didn't accept before the start date. 
    * Conflicted: A bet is beyond it's end date and the user & ther opponent both voted. However, they do not agree on the winner.
